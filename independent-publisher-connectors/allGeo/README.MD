## allGeo Connector

Example: Product Team needs to fill information.
Azure Key Vault provides a powerful and very extensive REST API.  Using this API, you can manage your keys, certificates, and secrets in an Azure Key Vault account.  Very often, you may want to leverage those secrets in your application, or in your process automation.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to proceed:
* A Microsoft Power Apps or Power Automate plan with custom connector feature

## Building the connector 
Example: Product Team needs to fill information.
Since Key Vault APIs are secured by Azure Active Directory (AD), we first need to set up a few thing in Azure AD so that our connectors can securely access the Key Vault.  After that is completed, you can create and test the sample connector.
